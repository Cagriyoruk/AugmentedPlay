## Environment Setup
For ios part we use unity 2018.  
* Unity 2018. 
  * Installed the ios SDK tools from unity hub.  
  * installed Vuforia Engine to work with AR  
  * set Vuforia in player settings for ios's configuration and activate vuforia augmented reality.  
  * We have to use a API key in order to use Vuforia. (So don't forget to get the key)  
After finish all the configuration and deploy the code for unity,go switch platform to ios and build, then like what we do in Covid app, do anything in xcode to deploy to the phone.
